Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Sales

Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth in Total Sales

Difference between YTD Sales and Previous Year-to-Date (PTYD) Sales

2️⃣ Average Price Analysis

YTD Average Price

YOY Growth in Average Price

Difference between YTD Average Price and PTYD Average Price

3️⃣ Cars Sold Metrics

YTD Cars Sold

MTD Cars Sold

YOY Growth in Cars Sold
